## Workspace Instructions
For this project, you will complete the work within the AWS lab provided through the Udacity classroom.

- Click through the AWS console to Amazon Sagemaker.
- Click through the main Sagemaker page to Amazon Sagemaker Studio from the left hand toolbar.
- If a user does not exist already in the Sagemaker Studio Control Panel, Add user.
- Select an execution role that has full Sagemaker Access, otherwise you can create a new role.
- Create a role and proceed with creating the user.
